            <p>Uses vacuum distillation to convert seawater into high-quality freshwater for domestic and process
                utilization on ships, rigs, as well as in remote onshore locations. Desalination of seawater is an
                economically feasible and reliable solution.
                The units are small, can be self installed and are easy to repair while still in the ground. Linacre
                sees farmers installing fleets of them in fields, where they could sit and water the plants with no
                human help. The pumps are even solar-powered, a great idea in deserts

            extracts water from humid ambient air. Water vapor in the air can be extracted by condensation - cooling the
            air below its dew point, exposing the air to desiccants, or pressurizing the air. Unlike a dehumidifier, an
            AWG is designed to render the water potable. AWGs are useful where pure drinking water is difficult or
            impossible to obtain, because there is almost always a small amount of water in the air that can be
            extracted. The two primary techniques in use are cooling and desiccants.

                A number of technologies, including the use of desiccants, can produce condensation by lowering the
                temperature below its dew point. But the condensers that are currently on the market need electrical
                energy to operate, which makes them tough to install in parts of the world in which more water is
                needed.

                Watenergy is a low-cost system that provides access to electricity and drinking water.
