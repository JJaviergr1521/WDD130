            <p>Where in actual worldwide is not necessary sufficient wáter to have a Good level lof life?
                Water scarcity is maybe the hugest problem that affects worldwide there are no countries or geographic
                áreas that don't suffer side effects of that issue
                We offer solutions for production water systems and show out why it is a trustworthy system to produce
                water being friendly with the environment, and looking for taking advantage we have an área that
                develops and looks for efficient technology at a low cost to cover all kinds of necessities.
                NEW WATER COMPANY is looking for a better life for our future generations.

            <h2>Renewal Drinking Water</h2>
            <p>
                provides a detailed resource on planning, design, and construction of trenchless rehabilitation
                technologies for pipelines carrying drinking water. Trenchless renewal, rather than open-cut pipe
                replacement, offers a variety of benefits, including lower risk of damage to surrounding area, fewer
                traffic disruptions, better public safety, and shorter completion times.

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The energy-water nexus of the water supply, wastewater treatment and power generation systems has been
                well
                discussed. It is very clear that one source cannot be produced or supplied without involving the other
                source. Since the two systems are intertwined with mutual needs, it is difficult to resolve the issues
                associated with them in isolation. However, combined solutions through integrated approaches may not be
                feasible in all situations. Therefore, it is important to consider the energy or water autarky
                (self-sufficiency) of these systems.</p>
