            <h2>Zero Mass Water </h2>
            <p>uses some nifty science to squeeze potable water from the air. Founder Cody Friesen, a materials
                scientist and associate professor at Arizona State University, spent nearly seven years developing the
                Source Hydropanel. Using solar power, a single system can produce enough drinking water for two to three
                people each day--even in desert conditions
                .</p>

            <h2>Solar panel</h2>
            <p>The solar panel converts sunlight to energy, which heats the material inside and creates condensation.
                Water collects in a 30-liter reservoir. Minerals are added to improve taste, and ozone is added to
                maintain purity. Then the water is pumped directly to a household tap or a refrigerator's fill station.
                Because the unit has its own solar panel, everything occurs off the grid.
