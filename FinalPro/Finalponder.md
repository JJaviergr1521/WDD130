Please take a few minutes to reflect on your experience in CSE 111 and
think about the challenges, successes, and all that you've learned
along the way.


Now, please respond thoroughly (1 - 2 paragraphs for each question) to
the following questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

For me functions is essencial part in programming doesnÂ´t matter wich programming language you atre using because I learne in this course that functions works for split a program and understand step by step what the program does.



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Personally I preffer like use the debugger because testing function it is like write an specific program to test other specific program for that reason i think that debuggin it is the best way to test a program but, I think also that testing programs with pytest it will be useful in many other situations.



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

Well mainly I when I write a program I test a quite portion each time I write and I go ahead if it is working, I think my way it is passive way to doit but it is works fine for me, I think that I need to use more and get more skills with the debugger.
